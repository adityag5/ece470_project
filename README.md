### project1.py ### 
This Python file contains the basic implementation of our project. It makes the end-effector go to a specified point to the front of the robot, activate the gripper and then depending on whether there is a block detected using the gripper sensor, it will pick it up and then move to a point to the back of the robot and then release it. This motion allows the robot arm to lay a path for itself.
